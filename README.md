## Introduction

This is a Docker container implementation of [DenverCoder1&#39;s GitHub Readme Streak Stats](https://github.com/DenverCoder1/github-readme-streak-stats) project. It allows you to self-host the streak stats generator service using Docker, making it easy to deploy and maintain.

> [!Note]
> You will still need an reverse proxy open to the public internet else it will work only locally.

> [!TIP]
> For this case, the [vercel installation](https://github.com/DenverCoder1/github-readme-streak-stats) is more suitable as it give you a public link to the service.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose (optional, but recommended)
- [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (no scopes required)

### Quick setup

1. Start the container using Docker:

```
docker run -d --network host --name streak-stats --restart unless-stopped -e TOKEN=<your-github-token> -e APPPORT=9000 qcdev/github-readme-streak-stats
```

> [!TIP]
> You can set the APPPORT for a more suitable Port on you system depending on your need.

### Using docker compose

1. Export your Github Token:

```sh
export TOKEN=<your-github-token>
```

2. Start the container using Docker Compose:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

The service will be available at `http://localhost:9000`

## Usage

Once the container is running, you can use it by replacing `streak-stats.demolab.com` with `localhost:9000` in your GitHub streak stats URL:

```md
[![GitHub Streak](http://localhost:9000/?user=qcoudeyr)](https://git.io/streak-stats)
```

### Configuration

The container can be configured using the following environment variables:

- `APPPORT`: The port the service will listen on (default: 9000)

You can modify these in the docker-compose.yml file or pass them directly to Docker.

## Docker Details

The container is based on Alpine Linux and includes:

- PHP 8.2 with required extensions
- Apache2
- Inkscape (for PNG rendering)
- Composer for PHP dependencies

The container automatically:

- Installs all required dependencies
- Sets up PHP and Apache
- Configures the application
- Exposes the specified port

## Known Issues and Limitations

- The container needs to be able to make outbound connections to GitHub's API
- PNG rendering requires additional memory due to Inkscape requirements
